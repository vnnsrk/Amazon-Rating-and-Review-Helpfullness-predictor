      "I meant to buy another pair of my favorite Carolina boots only to discover that model is no longer being made.  The Carolina boot that replaced it is now made in China.  I have nothing against products made in other countries per se, however, I have been very disappointed in the sizing of almost every pair of shoes/boots I have ever bought that was made in China.  I wear a US size 11EE as measured numerous times over the years in numerous shoe stores.  Unfortunately, this often translated into Chinese-made shoes and boots in sizes up to 12 EEEEE (one brand of well-known boots I tried in size 13 EW was too small for my size 11 foot).After discovering the Carolina boots were no longer available, I intended to go by the Red Wing store but looked at their prices and backed off.  Red Wings are good shoes but Red Wing really likes them a lot.  It was time to try something different.  I was happy to find out that Chippewa still makes their products in the USA and continues to maintain a good reputation at a reasonable price.  I had never owned any Chippewa boots before but I went ahead and ordered my usual 11EE from Amazon.The boots fit well.  At first, they felt a little loose.  I put on some thicker socks and tightened the lacing.  New leather boots always need time to conform to your feet and some heel slipping is pretty much normal until the soles flex a bit.  After a couple of hours wear, they began to feel  really good.  As the leather stretches and molds, it is easier to tighten the laces and the looseness is gone.  They feel good and the rounded toes offer plenty of \"wiggle room\".  In other words, they fit true-to-size for my feet.They appear to be well made.  While the label says \"Handcrafted In The USA\" it does not say \"Made In...\".  As best I can tell from this difference in wording, the boots were put together here in the USA but the leather and other materials may have been made in another country.  It seems many American tanneries have closed due to environmental regulations that made it unprofitable to continue to produce leather.  The tanning of most leather today is done--where else?--China.  So while shoes and boots may still be \"handcrafted\" in the USA, the materials are often from other countries.  At least the actual manufacture of the boot is here and Chippewa continues to build these boots to fit my made in the USA foot.Will these boots last for many years of frequent hard use?  This is still an unknown.  What I can say is that the boots appear to be put together well, they are comfortable on my feet and they fit perfectly.  The material looks to be quality leather, oil-tanned.  The soles are by Vibram but they are not heavily lugged so you won't bring a lot of debris in the house.  I like them a lot and I am very satisfied with the boot.  I may order a second pair as a hedge against this model being discontinued or production moving out of the country.\n",

      "I got this rain coat so I could take it to my 12-day Europe trip.  I was rainy season in Europe so this jacket was a life-saver.  I carried it with me in my backpack, and took it out several times a day when it started raining as I was sight seeing.  It is everything it said it was; it surpasses all my expectations also.  It is water proof, it is lined, it is long enough, it comes with a zipper and a waist tie, it has a great hood with a draw string in it, and it served it purpose of keeping me warm.  The other things I love about it, is that it is light, it is stylish, it doesn't make me overly warm, and it keeps me dry above all else.  I didn't even carry an umbrella; I just used this coat whenever I needed it.  It would dry fast and when it stopped raining, I 'd put it back in my backpack.  I always wanted a nice rain coat, but this is my first one and I'm 46!  It you want the best rain coat at a great price, I recommend this one hands down.  It is made of great materials, it cost-effective, does the job, and is made to last!\n",

      "Some time ago I have sworn that I will only use solar-powered watches that synchronize time with atomic clocks. Initially only quite expensive and 'stylish' models were available, but wearing a timepiece worth several hundred bucks while doing work around the house makes you constantly worried that you scratch precious thing.This watch is under $100 and has all the benefits of its more expensive 'brothers':- Solar powered quite efficiently - with normal daily exposure to light I'm always at the 'max charge' level (of course living in sunny Nevada helps here).- Time synchronization with the 5 radio transmitters all over the world (USA, England, Germany, Japan*2). I frequently travel to visit family in Europe, so USA and England/Germany transmitter sync is important to me. Many watches in the US only sync with USA transmitter or USA and Japan; the latest models just started supporting new China transmitters; this one is the perfect balance for me.- Time signal reception is excellent in Nevada, bot inside the buildings and outside. From my previous experiences it should mean good reception throughout the West Coast and (maybe!) some problems inside solid-construction buildings in New England and Florida.- Unlike some cheap models of watches and clocks, this one reads Daylight Savings Time data straight from the radio signal, so it 'springs ahead' and 'falls back' at the correct dates. Some older clocks have hard-coded DST transition dates and are confused after the recent DST changes in the USA.- I love 'Auto EL' feature: the watch turns on Electro-Luminescent backlight for two seconds when it is dark and the wearer positions hand appropriately. Perfect for the movies, night flights and similar situations.- I usually prefer metal bands, but resin band in this model is surprisingly good quality and wears OK.- Button operation seems to be reliable so far.- The glass is scratch resistant and placed recessed in the metal panel - so far I managed to keep it clear, which is unusual for me.Amazon had the best price for this item, better than Fry's and Casio website. The watch arrived on time and in good shape.\n",

Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a \"buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly\" promotion and Amazon prime, so my \"refund\" would be less than nothing.That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.

There, I said it.I have such big boobs, in fact, that the largest cup size (DDD) of this particular model is just a teensy bit too small to hold in my particular sweater puppies. But I buy them anyway because Bali got it right with this one; in fact I've gone through several because they're the only bras I wear.The under-wires, though they will eventually break (it's inevitable if you are blessed with enormous melons), are comfortable, which is hard to be if you're an underwire.The cups themselves are soft and cozy, and there are no seams - no bullet bras here!The straps are padded where they should be, as opposed to way too far in front like some of the more \"just add more fabric to the cup\" types of extra-endowed bras out there...those folks don't realize that the massive mammaries drag the bra *forward*...which means if you leave the straps the same as for the B-cuppers, those half-conceived padded bits will be somewhere on the front of the shoulder, doing nobody any good at all.Lastly, you should know this is NOT a minimizer. At all. And why should it be?! Be PROUD of your assets! Don't strap em' in like they did something wrong! Let them be round and bouncy and pleasant for all to behold, including you. Grab one of these accurately-sized bras (measure yourself first, check online for the way to do it properly) and a v-neck t-shirt, and let em' be happy hooters.The only thing I wish for this bra would be a few more cup sizes, and more color... if I could, I'd buy this bra in every color of the rainbow.

That was a bonus for me. It made me feel better about using a site that I was not familiar with. They even came in two days.Now for the review. I have multiple pairs of Fitflops. They work well for my feet. I have a bunion on my right foot. The sling style fits around it with no problem. Recently, I developed tendonitis in my left foot from extensive walking on a rocky surface in thin soled \"skeletoes.\" The thick sole of the Fitflop is my saving grace as I work through physical therapy. I wear them 24/7. I generally love the Fitflop brand. Never am I disappointed in the fit or look.Pros:Style - the sling style makes them dressy enough for me to wear to workSizing - I wear 8.5 US: the 39 is a great fitComfort - I can walk an 8 hour day without pain/discomfortCons:It would be nice to have them be a bit less expensive.

      "I purchased a 2X and used this product the day after it arrived.  I went for my usual 3 mile walk and really felt no difference but did notice that my legs felt hotter than normal and that they felt very heavy after the walk.  I sat down and removed my tennis shoes and sat for awhile talking to my daughter.  I told her that I just spent $50 on this and thought it was a waste of money.  As i sat, I saw water running down my leg but thought it was just from sweating on the leg section that was uncovered. I went to the bathroom to shower and took off the capris and to my surprise, they were soaking wet in the inside and it was then that I realized that my legs felt heavy because of the additional weight of the sweat that was soaked into the capris.  Amazing fact is that the outer section did not feel wet but the inner section was soaked - it was that sweat that was running down my legs.  Suffice to say that in the first 2 weeks that I wore the capris, I lost 10 lbs and enough inches on my legs and thighs to go down almost 2 sizes in my pants. I am short waisted so I had to roll down the top section of the capris to make them fit properly but they kept rolling down because my waist up is proportionately smaller than from the waist down.  For that reason, I took no points off - its my body style, not the capris.  On my next walk, I rolled them over so that the inner section flaps over the outside and placed 2 safety pins in the waist.  A week later, I sewed them down and put a draw string from other sweat pants in the waist and now they fit perfectly.  Others have mentioned the odor and the swishing sound - all of this is true but I rinsed them out in water and downy and no longer smelled the odor after that.  I rinse them after each use and hang on my sun porch to drip dry - there is no shrinkage or anything.  Insofar as the swishing sound, I don't care because I am seeing results and assume that if I continue at this pace, the legs wont rub and there wont be anymore swishing.  Suffice to say that I love these and imagine that I will soon be purchasing an XL soon.\n",

Also, if your foot runs on the wider side of normal, get a bigger size. They were a bit stiff after I first put them on, but after about 30mins of wearing them, they started to feel better.

      "I have gotten back into running the past 6 months or so after being a near-sedentary couch potato through college (I was reprehensibly lazy). Because I live in New Orleans, the places where I jog/run are full of broken bits and boulders of concrete, tree roots coming up from the sidewalk, and rocks. It might seem counterintuitive to trade a padded, protective shoe for a minimal shoe in such an environment, but after a couple sprained ankles due to tree roots and lack of foot to brain input, I figured it would be easier running barefoot. That said, tetanus from urban ground debris just wasn't an option, so I chose the next best thing: these shoes!I can feel what's underfoot and my feet can bend over obstacles without balancing on them as with a traditional running shoe. When transitioning to these shoes (I just went cold turkey), you will notice soreness in muscles you didn't even realize you had. However, the pain I can only attribute to my persistent heel striking in traditional shoes is now gone. I had horrible, and I mean horrible shin splints, and they are also completely gone. I do have some muscle soreness, but that's mostly just me being pretty out of shape, and it's a \"good\" pain, not a pain that I would attribute to an injury, or a pain I can't train through. It goes away with a hot bath.Overall, this is a great, fun-looking, lightweight, cool shoe. I can feel the air on my feet when I run which is a far cry from my old damp/hot, overpadded trainers. Ditch the padding! This shoe forces you to change your biomechanics back to what nature intended: a shorter stride, faster cadence, upright posture, and springy landing on the forefoot. This minimizes injuries by keeping you in tune with your body and the ground.Bonuses: 1. the fabric has a really cool reptilian feel to it.2. The styling is adorable.3. THE COLORS! DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SKY! IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!\n",

      "Ok, ladies.  The review on Allegra K's clothes are confusing because it seems people love or hate the clothes.  Well, this is my first time purchasing anything from this line.  Listen, I'm glad I did.  What I did was 1) Picked out my most FAVE thing from her line 2) followed the sizing info provided by the company providing the item 3) took a risk and just bought one.  Doing it this way you are only out 10-12 bucks so why not?I'm glad I did.  I ordered a small, which said it was a US size 4.  I'm usually between a 4-6 or small-medium.  This was scary because all the reviews say this stuff runs SMALL and then TOO BIG. And it's all soooo confusing. What's a girl to do?!? ;-)So I just followed the guidelines given and ordered the small.  It fits perfectly for me...maybe a TAD bit bigger than I would like.  But, I got sooo many compliments on my outfit. People just loved it.I wore it with knit leggings, a white scarf and thigh high heelless boots and people called me a Snowflake Princess.  Ha!  I think the material is a good quality...but again, I don't mind cheap stuff. .  I shop at Forever 21 all the time and  take good care of all my items (DON'T DRY!) and my clothes last forever.

      "Alright, so if you're a skinny guy and you want some very lightweight and comfortable pants, these are what you want. If you are, like me, a large fellow with a body shape not popularized in catalogs or the media, you do not want these pants. They look like skinny jeans on me, and skinny jeans do NOT look good on me. My wife couldn't stop laughing, which was not my desired reaction.The upside? They're stitched well, are super soft, lightweight, and even have pockets!  Yes, pockets, so you can have your phone in your pocket while you walk around the house in comfort. They have a single button on the fly, so they won't gape open in an obscene manner.All that being said, I would NOT leave my apartment in these pants, unless I wanted to end up being arrested for public indecency.edit/update: Alright, I don't know what's going on, but I got a pair of XXL (thinking this might resolve some of the issues I had with my XL pair) and they are ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. Hanes must have redesigned these pants or something, because my new pair didn't pill up with fuzzies all over them, and they were HUGE. I mean, they are like full-on yoga pants. Maybe this is a design distinction between the XL and XXL sizes or something, I don't know, but my XL pair was like leggings, and my XXL pair is like wearing a pair of Andre the Giant's yoga pants. They're longer and the seat/groin/everywhere IS HUGE. Remember Pee Wee's Playhouse, that old show that was on Saturday mornings? When Pee Wee would pay in his giant underpants? Yeah, that's how much bigger my XXL pair were than my XL pair. Anyway, the fabric is nicer, the fit is much more like what I expect from \"lounge\" pants or \"sleep\" pants. In short, they made a vast improvement, and my guess is that all the sizing and fit stuff changed from one incarnation of these pants to the next.I'd post before/after photos, but again -- I don't want to be jailed for public indecency.\n",

Gold-tone hands with luminous fill make it easy to tell time day or night, and the back of the watch has month, day and year information.  More importantly the bottom portion of the rear of the watch has a soul-trap where, once the children are finished making the watch, they sacrifice themselves and let the stone absorb their youthful essence.  This, in turn, allows the wearer of the watch to maintain a youthful and glowing appearance their entire lives and only requires a recharge every 2 to 3 years.  (For more information regarding recharging the soul stone and proper human sacrificing techniques refer to the user manual).  The polished gold case extends to meet the brown child-leather strap which wraps comfortably around the wrist and fastens with a traditional buckle.

      "These boots are pretty much exactly what you'd expect for the price tag.  I do not imply that they're a waste of money or anything of that sort.  In fact, I really like my pair.  But they're best suited for \"cheap, knock-around boots\" when you are looking for rather disposable clothing.  I bought mine for paintball, knowing full well I will destroy them in months, and couldn't be more pleased.  Here's everything I've noticed about them:Overall construction:-The stitching looks a bit light-duty.  Expect some breakage in due time.-Vent holes, eyelets, and canvas seem middle-of-the-line.  Same as above.-The laces that come with these boots aren't actually boot laces.  Think long shoelaces.-Soles seem to be soft rubber that will wear easily.  Conversely, the lugs are thick allowing for plenty of wear.Fit and feel:-These were designed to be worn with boot socks (two pair of socks will also suffice), meaning they will run big.-Because of the above, they are also unlined.  Without proper socks, they can have some hot spots that would no doubt blister, especially when new.  Wearing thick socks or two pair eliminates this completely.-They are extremely lightweight, great for all-day comfort.  I was thoroughly impressed by this.-Even with socks on and out in the heat, they seem to vent incredibly well.  My feet never seem hot.Consensus:Great for occasional wear.  If you just need a set of boots to get dirty, scuffed, torn up, and otherwise mistreated, there is no better deal on the planet.  If you are looking for a genuinely hardcore pair of boots to break-in, take care of, do 30-mile marches in, and that you will miss when you must say goodbye, skip them.UPDATE 11/23/2012:To my surprise, they are still holding up quite well.  I bought a pair of insoles for them -- a must -- but they aren't torn up or ruined.  Still using them for paintball.\n",

      "These shoes are very comfortable. They feel like they hug every angle of my feet. The velcro straps lets you adjust the width in the front and back of shoe. They are not as cute as the Teva Kayenta, which I also own, but they are definitely more comfortable. Great for casual travel, walks.\n",

      "I own several styles of Kangol's and wish there were more reviews on them. It's tough to know how they're going to fit ahead of time since you usually can't go to the mall and try all the styles on. I own several of the Ventair 504's in size Large. I'm normally a 7 3/8 in New Era 5950 baseball caps for sizing reference.The Ventair 504 is pretty much the flagship hat of the Kangol brand. If you're looking to buy one and only one Kangol, or need a place to start, this is the one to buy. It's a timeless classic. It can be worn by anyone from hip-hoppers to old-timers on the golf course.The Ventair 504 is very comfortable, lightweight, and very breath-able. The vent-air holes go around the entire side of the hat so it never gets too stuffy. The hat is made of polyester, so it folds very flat for easy storage if you're taking it on vacation.I find the hat quite roomy in terms of fit. You can pull it all the down to your eyebrows pretty easily without it looking funny/ stretching badly. Or you can wear it backwards. Or tilted to the side. They all look fine. Plus, they come in a variety of colors so you can always find a color to go with any outfit.Overall it's the classic Kangol model for good reason.\n",

      "I bought these at a BOGO sale locally. I bought this pair, a Bikila, a KomondoSport,  a Jaya, and a TrekSport(see my other reviews on those).This shoe is sized accurately to width and length. I wear a solid 41 in EU size(look on the tounge of your favorite athletic shoe in the EU section for this number).I like the tread on this shoe. It is a good, solid all terrain design.I like the removable insoles with a bit extra cushion(this makes it a good beginner Vibram minimalist shoe).I like the bungee cord with slider adjustment on the top/ankle of the shoe.Cons:They could be hot as they have a heavier material on the uppers.A bit more sole to them.These would be your true cross trainer/everything type shoe. If you are looking for a good first pair of \"barefoot\" shoes to try, these would be the ones. Running, jumping, walking, hiking, lifting, cross fit, p90x, indoors, outdoors, etc.Out of the 5 pairs of VFFs I have, these are my favorite. Although, in the summer they are the hottest pair so I tend not to wear them as often as my others.A note on fitting the odd toes....I have a second toe that is longer than my first, by alot actually. In every other shoe I own, this causes me to need to size up a half size in US(so one number in EU). VFFs are no different. My other toes might have a little extra room to move in the ends but this is my normal mode of operating so my feet are used to it. This causes me no issues in these shoes.VFF has sizing info on their website about measuring your feet to the correct sizing. It's pretty spot on. Just measure your longest toe(which might not always be your big toe!)\n",

      "As a collector of watches, I generally look for a design that captures my attention. I am a very big fan of dive watches and usually I buy within that category. This piece however, I received as a gift from my mother. At first when I saw that it was a piece by Stuhrling, I was disappointed due to the fact that I own a few of their products, and all my experiences has been either a hit or miss. The overall look has a resembance to the great Rolex Submariner, however different enough to stand on it's own. One aspect Stuhrling does very well is their packaging. This piece comes packed inside a beautiful case that includes the paperwork and instruction manual, it is great to give as a gift. Now, I will be setting my review up by focusing on three main aspects of the watch, so you can focus and read upon what is the most important aspect to you.**REVIEW**Body - The body of the watch is well done, it is crafted from 316 stainless steel and has a brushed finish. The diameter of the body is about 42mm and the thickness is about 11-12mm. Not so sure about sizing in milimeter? Well the body is a bit above the average size, however it sits very well on the wrist. The thickness of the watch is very slim and can be worn very comfortably even with long sleeve shirts. The dial and bezel consists of the classic color combination of black and white. The layout of the dial is very simple, done with Arabic numerals and white hour markers. The hour and minute hand consist of a very unique shape and is an uncommon design, they are done in the shape of a sword which gives them a very masculine appearance. The bezel is very poorly made in terms of finish and quality and it cheapens the overall look of the watch. The crystal protecting the dial is known as Krysterna. Krysterna is a trademarked technique that belongs to Stuhrling and it is stated by the company that the crystal is as durable as sapphire when it comes to scratch resistance and as hard as mineral crystal when it comes to impact. However I cannot vouch for that since there isn't actual proof and I truly believe it is just a marketing scheme, or it can also be a copy of Seiko's hardlex crystal, which is very reliable. The crown is screwed down, which means you need to turn it in order to unscrew the crown to open and pull it out, then you change the time and date. The screwed down crown mechanic enables the watch body to have the ability to be water resistant up to 200M, which is about 660FT, however these watches aren't water tested and no one knows for sure if they are actually water resistance up to 200MM. Overall, very nice presentation and it is very appealing.Movement - The movement in this watch is a Swiss parts Quartz Ronda 515, what that means is that it is a movement that is Chinese made but has a few Swiss parts integrated to use the term \"Swiss\". This movement is usually used in watches in the lower price ranges due to it's low price and high quantity being available for watch companies to use. However, it is an accurate movement and my watch has been keeping time within 1 minute compared to the atomic clock over a 3 week span, so that is good for a low tier watch but it is also to be expected since it is a quartz movement .The battery life of this movement can range anywhere between 3-4 years, so it has a very generous duration per battery change. For the price, it is a good movement that is being provided.Strap/Band - The band of the watch has a very nice appearance. The band has two different finish, the outer links are done with a brushed finish to match the body, and the inner links are done with a very high polish finish to give the band a very contrast look and it is absolutely gorgeous. However, the band is very cheap, light and it isn't very durable but it is expected due to the low price point of this watch. Most companies that offer affordable watches usually tend to cut down the quality on their bands due to the cost of production. The length of the band is about 7 3/4 inches, so it isn't a very generous size and some men might have to order additional links in order to get a perfect fit. The band has a nice appearance however it isn't the greatest quality.At the end of the day this is an affordable watch that keeps good time and has a good appearance. It is meant to be an everyday watch that you can bang around and put under rough usage. If your someone that is just looking for an everyday watch that you don't have to worry about much, then this is a good option but keep in mind that the quality can be a hit or miss. Hopefully I have helped! if you have any question or comment, feel free to contact me.Update 7/01/2013As of three weeks ago, the movement has broken down and the minute hand has fallen off the watch. I did use it as my beater and put it under quiet a lot of stress, so I guess if you are looking for a heavy duty watch, I would avoid this one and look at companies such as Orient, Luminox, Deep Blue, Seiko and Citizen.\n",

      "EDIT: I like these socks enough that I ordered a second helping. These socks are thick and durable. I thought they would be a little warmer than they are. I bought them for winter wear with combat boots in Kabul, Afghanistan. Turns out they work well in the hot season and just OK in cold weather. Cushiony, comfortable and easy to get on and off.\n",

      "I had been looking for this watch style for quite awhile.  The prices of watches, at the stores, ranged from $48 to $200.  I was a bit skeptical about purchasing an $8.00 watch, but after reading all the other reviews, I thought I would give it a chance.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  The watch is exactly as pictured and described.  It actually looks so much better than many I saw in the department stores.  I have a small wrist, but it was no problem to trim/cut the band to better suit my wrist.  It looks great!  I was so amazed that a nice looking watch could be purchased at such a low price... plus the shipping charges can't be beat.  I paid $10.94 inclusive of shipping... what a fantastic buy.  I am now going to order this watch in a couple more different colors!\n",

      "It is what it is an expensive (cheap) belt, but I needed a silver belt, inexpensive so thought this would fit the bill.  I give it two stars instead of three out of sheer annoyance.  I ordered this in a small.  Why? because I wear a small and know my size.  However, they intentionally sent me a medium size, along with a note that 'if it doesn't fit I could return it'.  I did not order a medium and,no, it did not fit. To return it, means a trip to the post office, pay for shipping and oh, they suggested tracking on the return, so by the time you add it all up there is a couple of dollars, if any left for a true refund. I should have received a notice prior to shipping that the item in my size was 'out of stock' and given an option to cancel or wait until my size came in.  Instead, I got stuck with a belt that is too big.Last order I will place from them.\n",

      "So I bought the black, charcoal heather,and neon pink cardigans in Large. I wanted them to go over some thin shirts I have,and some tanks, and a pair of jeans. I have a curvyish body(latina), 5'3, and about 140-143 lbs,depends. We are all shaped differently, but for those of us with a fuller or maybe just some curves, these cardigans will fit nicely for you. I have a small waist, but my tummy isnt flat,its got some pudge but I'm not cryin over it. But I do admit I like my clothes to look flattering nonetheless, so I wouldnt be wearing anything that singles my tummy chubs. The size Large actually fits pretty big, its not too big, but its loose on ME and I think its fine. I probably could've gone with a size Medium, and it would have fit little snugger but I think it would have looked fine as well. They are reallllllllly cute cardigans, the v-neck is kinda depper than what I expected, so you definitely need something high enough to cover cleavage so you're not falling out, I'm a 36B-C(I'd be a B and a half technically). So when I wear them they look fine, but some bigger chested women should beware and have some good tops on underneath LOL. They aren't really too thin, makes me feel warm enough on a breezy day, and the bottom of the cardigan reaches to about even right at mid-private area. I would definitely buy more colors from them later on :)\n",

These are also very tight on my leg and I haven't washed them yet so they will shrink even tighter. I would advise trying another style or brand if you are looking for comfort and durability.

So I wore them today at Legoland all day, and my feet were not very happy at the end of the day.  First, I felt the springs on my heels, and my heels became sore in the middle of the day.  Second, the sides of my small toes were hurting as well, both feet, by afternoon.  I cannot figure out why since nothing really felt hard on the side of the shoes, but regardless, they were tender after a long day of walk.  It felt like I am wearing a pair of dress shoes when they are supposed to be comfortable walking shoes.I do not understand how $100 shoes are made such that I feel the springs on my heels?  I actually felt round shape of springs on my heels.  Can't you believe it?  The company cannot put thick enough padding?In terms of my small toes, I bought wide shoes.  I had enough space on the front so I cannot figure out why the side of my toes hurt.I am very unhappy.  Since I wore the pair outside for one day, I cannot return them, and it cost me $100.  It is very expensive shoes to be thrown away after one day of wear.My suggestion: they look okay, but they are not good for walking unless you are perfectly fine walking on dress shoes for all day.\",\n",

They heard a dog bark on the next property and went tearing off, with me in hot pursuit in my new slippers. I probably ran about 6 acres through Canada Thistle, sage brush, AND CACTI GALORE. My point in telling all of this is that these slippers held up great. After getting home 45 minutes later I pounded them together to get all the various pointy/sharp plant matter off and put them back on. Ahhh, comfort.UPDATE:6 months later and the left toe has ripped out. After my first \"run through the sagebrush\" I have largely worn these shoes inside, with brief trips out to the trash can, et cetera.

The sleeves are what you tie up around the neck, around the back, etc.  It's just not cute on.  I ordered my regular size, a medium, and it was true to size.  But the top has excess material around the stomach, forming an unsightly bunch of floppy saggy material around the waist-not a good look. I might have kept it for half the price that I paid, but definitely not worth the cost. When I tried it on as a regular shirt, the batwing is so extreme I looked like I was in a flight suit! Goodness. The material is a t-shirt type material, I ordered the red and you could see my bra through it.  The shipping only took about a week, so that part was wonderful.  Sorry, but this one just didn't work for me! Adding to that, I had a hard time returning it. Never again with patty boutique. I have ordered twice from them before, and I think their clothing is overpriced for the mediocre quality.Update: I returned the shirt, with tracking, in original condition. The seller ignored all of my emails, and I had to file an Amazon claim to get my money back. Terrible experience, and I would never buy from this seller again!\",\n",

I got these in 8.5 and my feet could not even get into them. My sister who is a 7.5 could not wear them either. Thus should be Yankee off the amazon Web site.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I wear a 44 G in typical everyday bras. I ordered both the 46 and the 48 F/G in this bra because of the combined cup size. The 46 was small in the cup for me. I had some spillage both on the sides and in the front of the bra. The straps felt short as well, due to my breasts overwhelming the cups and requiring the extra stretch of the material. The band itself fit fine.If you normally wear a F cup, you may be fine with your regular band size or want to go up one size. If you have full breasts and are a definite G cup, I recommend ordering 1-2 sizes up. The 48 F/G fits me far better than the 46 because of the extra cup allowance.I ordered the Leading Lady Women's Plus Size Bra Sleep Leisure Bra at the same time but was concerned about the 10 front hooks. I thought the back hooks on the Glamorise Active Comfort Wrap Bra would easier to work with my tennis elbow than front hooks. I was wrong. Also to my surprise, I dislike the crossover feature in the front. It seems to provide less upward support than the Leading Lady. It's almost as if the wrap aspect pushes down on my breasts, which is uncomfortable and unhelpful as their weight already causes them to naturally sag.While this bra doesn't provide nearly enough support for me to use it as a sports bra, it is built like one. The material is much thicker and scratchier than that of the Leading Lady. The mesh on the sides may be meant to allow your skin to breathe but I found it irritated the skin on my inner arms within moments of trying it on. It might not be bad once you put a shirt on top of it, but aside from the 46 being too small in the cup, I wasn't going to risk it.I should have taken the words &#34;sport bra&#34; more seriously because I'm really looking for a leisure/sleep bra. This bra serves neither purpose for me. It's not comfortable enough for a leisure bra, nor supportive enough for a sports bra.Though the 48 F/G fit in the cup, I can't recommend this bra at all, for any purpose.\",\n",

I now realize that I need to ammend my previous review in an effort to prevent others from buying this watch. I have a PhD, but this is an impossible watch to program. Admittedly I am not real \"tech-savy\" but I can follow directions. The directions that came with the watch are useless. I was hopeful that I\\'d solved the programming problem after calling Timex, but I was wrong. In trying to change the time when I was in England and again when I changed time zones, I found it impossible to change the time. What do the 4 buttons mean - it does not approach being intuitive. The person I spoke with at Timex was sympathetic and emailed me directions that were equally impossible. Yes,it is comfortable and the color is not objectionable, but I can\\'t get it to tell the right time! I don\\'t need any other features than to tell the time. I don\\'t need the stop watch or alarm functions. If I did, I can\\'t imagine that I could program it to do those functions either. At one point, buy accident, I got the correct time and the was afraid to push any buttons for fear that I would lose the time I had even if it was an incorrect time. I could do the mental calculations to change the time zone. Again do not buy this watch! Web site and other web info is not helpful.',\n",

The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I can't stand it. My old 505s did not do this. The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them. They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle.

I later discovered one of my bridesmaid purchased a small after I was told they were out and would not be restocking them any time soon, they told me to just reject the delivery and once i did they would save a small and send it to me. Because the post office delivered the dress to a neighboring business I couldn't refuse it. So instead of being kind enough to understand and allow me to return the dress for a size replacement, she said I could only return it and re purchase another.

I tried to get the clasp on this one to work and it was the same as the first. She finally got it to hook, but not while on my wrist. By the way, I was already irritated with her long, decorated and embelished purple fingernails and her attitude. I finally  gave up and left. When reading the reviews I see that I am not the only one who had problems with the clasp. One 'expert'said the size of the clasp and the hook did not match up.

But, the midsole lost its cushioning very fast. I ended up with two pair. I would not get another. So many shoes these days are not holding up that this shoe may look tempting but it still will not do any better. It is looks only. I have gotten more use out of this pair than the 8's but only because I added an insole to this one and used it to walk a lot. It is really not a great walking shoe either. The only good thing I can think about this shoe is that it does have normal lacing. Some new shoes have some cheap fabric that the laces pull through. Those shoes will not last at all. Even with the correct lacing and good looks ( The soles look like they should hold up), I give this shoe a 1 star.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I own several pair of Merrells...from sandals to sneakers to boots. They have been the most comfortable brand of shoes I\\'ve owned.....until these. I read the excellent reviews on the shoe prior to ordering. Can\\'t understand these \"rave\" reviews. These shoes are definitely made for a wide foot, have no adjustment whatsoever for width, and run a little small in length. I wanted to exchange them, but after reading the invoice (which did not include the price of the shoe, by the way), I found I would be responsible for return shipping and a further shipping charge for an exchange...which I was not willing to do. So, to make them work, I had to line the top of the sandal with two layers of moleskin, plus add an insert in the ball of the shoe to prevent slippage. My foot slid through the toe opening. Cute shoes, but a horrible fit. Very disappointed in this product and the return policy. Won\\'t be purchasing Merrells again from Amazon, since they are shipped from another supplier.',\n",

Also, the fabric is very chintzy and does not \"hang well.\" Lastly, I ordered two different dresses; I ended up (and was double charged) for two of the first dress (same color, same size????)and one of the second dress. I am going to send them back. Darling in the pictures, on par with Wal*Mart in quality. Too bad. If they were made of decent fabric and sewn better, they would be stunning. As it is the dress \"Laney\" is see-through and has no lining. You really can\\'t even wear it without a full slip at least (and probably Spanx). The other dress I ordered is red, but just as cheaply made, and the fabric is so thin that you can actually see through a burgundy-red dress! They should double the price (if needed)and just make these dresses look like they do in the ad. I would have bought the dress at twice the price if I could actually wear it to work. Really cute concept, very poor execution.',\n",

The buttons on the front look very cheap (no wonder, because the brand I received is something like Nan Yuan Lu). Nothing looks like the picture, even the tag.

I also know that shopping online always runs the risk of something not being quite what we hope it is supposed to be. So, I am very open-minded and never disappointed when something doesn't quite peg my satisfaction meter. I am not one of these silly Yelp numb-brains that lives in a bubble and finds fault with 75% of the restaurants that they go to. If you read any of my many reviews here on Amazon, I don't think I have ever really complained about anything else.However, that being said . . . the Konflict folks are either all &#34;little people&#34;, &#34;skinny jeans people,&#34; or &#34;really just want to make kids clothing people.&#34; Now, there's nothing wrong with any of those things. However, don't market what should be a small or medium shirt as XL or 2XL. After purchasing 4 of their XL and 2XL shirts, I would have to assume that their &#34;small&#34; might fit a toddler. I am 6'/200lb. and in good shape - not overweight. 90% of 2XL shirts fit me perfectly, with even a little room to spare. The Konflict &#34;2XL's&#34; fit me like they were painted on - no exaggeration. Konflict's men's Shirt Sizing Chart show XL at 46-48 inches chest size, and 2XL at 50-52 inches. I am 48 inches and their 2XL fits like they sent me a small.In this day and age, if you are going to market shirts to fit 118 pound guys that have &#34;abs&#34; simply because they are so skinny that they'd have abs even if they never did a situp, then at least put something to that effect in your product description, such as, &#34;very form fitting - sizes run very small compared to other T-shirt manufacturers.&#34;So, as a guide for anyone reading this . . . I would say if you are 5'7&#34; to 5'10&#34; and between 150 to 175 pounds, then you might like the 2XL. If you are 7 years old, then the Small should be right up your alley.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Update:Wore it for the second time today and took the dog out for a walk. It keeps riding up and it became really annoying, so I am returned it. My little trick does still work, but when you need to do it every few seconds, it gets old FAST. If you stand around and not move much all day, this can still work for you.Back to where it came from, unfortunately...I really wanted it to work...ugh........_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Does it ride up? Yes. Is it bad? Not really. Does it \"slim\" my body? No. Is it hard to get in and out of it? Yes at first. Is it worth the price? Yes. Would I ever consider buying another one of the same? Maybe. On time shipping? Yes.After the main questions, I\\'ll explain:The length of the slip on the thighs is good, but I think if it were longer, it would not ride up as often. I have to pull it down ever so often, but it really doesn\\'t bother me much as I have figured out an easy way to do so. And no matter how I walk or sit, the riding up stops where my butt line starts, so I don\\'t walk around with my badonkadonk hanging out. I wear this with a long sheer pleated skit. Looks very sex-eh :-DThe body slip part is definitely convenient as you can wear a strapless at the same time. It\\'s smooth so it doesn\\'t stick to any fabric.The bra, like per another reviewer, flattens your boobs as there is no \"push-up\" or any other fancy feature, but again, did you pay for any of those features? No. So, there you go. If you want boobs with this, put in padding or something. If you got big boobs, this can help you with your problem.Do remember to put this one on BEFORE the makeup, you\\'ll see what I mean... The first time I tried it on, from the bottom of the slip, it was hard to get in. OH MY GOD! Of course, I knew that wasn\\'t going to be easy, but it was quite annoying. The taking out was NOT fun either....BUT, on the second time, I decided to get in from the TOP of the slip and I was able to pull it up, carefully, past my hips and voila! I have the slip on in no time and feeling great/proud of myself. Of course, I don\\'t know if you are as lucky as I am on this one. I took it off the same way and it was fine. Wheeew, I hate it less now.It does what it is supposed to do: keep things in place and keeps you from flashing people, for free.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I have been buying and practically living in size 9 Crocs Patricia sandals for over four years, so I thought that I had found myself a comfortable, well-fitting boot.  On the Crocs website, customer service told me that this boot would have a similar footbed and fit/size.  It did not.  To start, the left boot fit me more tightly than the right one, and I happen to know my right foot is slightly larger than my left.  The boots are difficult to get into, because they are so constricted at the ankle - where the shaft meets the shoe, so to speak.  I could only get my feet into them with nylons on - socks would be impossible.  Although the ankle is extremely tight, the toe box is huge.  The footbed is oddly-shaped, and what is probably supposed to be the arch support is too far forward, and more of a circle or dome than the curved sort of half-circle that most arch supports resemble.  Furthermore, the top of the boot appears in the picture to have elastic at the top - it does not.  So it does not embrace slender calves like mine, and would be unforgiving towards women with fuller calves.  Altogether unsatisfactory - these boots do not seem to me to be made for human feet because they are so oddly shaped and the footbed is so peculiar.',\n",

Very disappointed.UPDATED 17 OCT: My husband wore this for four days and because the clasp is a little cheaply made and doesn't fit together well it fell off and he's already lost it.

With all the bells that come with G Shock watches, I'd be more inclined to put my money there.  It tells time and has a stop watch.  Yes it is waterproof down to a good depth.  But here in Ohio, not much swimming in the ocean going on here in January.  What it doesn't have that i'm totally accustomed to is a back light and a calendar.  I look at my watch often and I really like to be reminded of the day and date, so that is what I miss most I guess.  While wearing this I do find myself using my iPhone a lot more to check the time and calendar too.  So, it is a good watch.  I like how it looks quite a bit.  Last thing I dislike would be the control buttons on the right side, simply because I wear it on my left wrist.  They are kind of large, and the center one really digs in pretty good.Update: 7/30/13Okay.  This watch is not worth the money!  Never keeps accurate time... that is until I set at the correct time.  I've had the watch into the jewelers for battery replacement, which is what I thought the problem was... He said batter has plenty of power, it's just poor design.  All in the hands, and their inability to go past/over one another.  They keep catching and don't have enough power to keep on going.  I can not and DO NOT recommend this watch to anyone.  Jeweler tip... He stays away from anything INVICTA makes.  Overall a poor brand to start with.  So, there you go.\",\n",

The watch portion hangs oddly, and the leather is extremely stiff and scratchy. Also, the rings that hold the watch piece on seem very cheap, as if they'll break at any moment. The watch is so uncomfortable that I never even wore it.The ONE positive to this item is that it has three snaps to attach it to your wrist and that worked very nicely. I have extremely small wrists and finding a watch that fits well can be difficult. I put it on the third snap and the watch fit fine. It's unfortunate that it wasn't I expected because it really seems like it would be a cute watch.\",\n",

So my foot doesnt stay in the shoe, they feel like they are going to go flying forward with every step. I never had a pair of shoes like this before, they are just horrible. (My guess is they werent made in this country) I agree with the reviewer who noted that she spent the entire time trying to keep them on her feet. I bought these to wear to work (pre-school)since we are not permitted to wear sandals in the summer. The sandals would be safer and more comfortable than these.

Actually I think it is also an ugly shoe but it seems to me that many current hiking shoes have unattractive color and design. Funny, I see the ugly shoes online but I never see them on anyone's feet. Hmm.\",\n",

In fact, I\\'ve only worn them to walk my dog.Don\\'t waste your money!  Get UGGS.Edit:Afterthought -- I noticed these boots are made by Slippers International.  Maybe they were supposed to be worn as slippers and only in the house.Edit:And what really tics me off is I can resole them myself ... for the same price I paid for the boots!  What a ripoff!',\n",

The part that is supposed to go over the top of the ear was super uncomfortable to start with, but it also was not long enough for the part that goes in my pierced hole to reach. so I tried to bend it.

Kind of like a toddler chewed the hole instead of having been made by a skilled hand or machine. The logo is not a big deal but it\\'s representative of the workmanship of the product.The inside has 12 slots for credit cards and 1 open window for an ID. I loaded 12 regular plastic credit cards and a driver\\'s license into them, and the wallet won\\'t shut. If I then lay the wallet flat on a desk, one side sticks up at a 30-degree angle. This is with no cash in the wallet, and nothing in the four inner pockets that aren\\'t visible when the wallet is open (the ones behind the visible card slots).I\\'m not expecting the best wallet in the world for $11, but if I can\\'t even put 1 card in each wallet slot, then what is it good for?Edit: Changing from 2 to 1 star. I tried out this wallet with cash. I put 10 bills in the area for bills and 2 credit cards in the card slots and the wallet sticks up at 45 degrees when placed on a table. With 2 cards and no bills, it stays closed. This is literally the worst wallet I have ever owned.',\n",

The second pair (the same size shoe order as the first pair) was smaller than the first pair. As other reviews have noted - they run small. The second pair also had a hard spot where the side of the shoe joined the sole and that alone was reason enough to send it back.  The insert is a cheap foam that is wrinkled and does not fit well. They claim these are Ortholiite inserts, but look nothing like the soles that are sold on Amazon's website by the same name.  The &#34;rocker bottom&#34; design is a cheap knock off of the MBT and does not give you the same feel at all.  The picture fails to show how the &#34;rocker bottom&#34; effect is achieved and in reality the shoe feels pretty flat as you walk in it.

I haven't washed the shirt yet, and maybe I shouldn't. It seriously is what most would refer to being thread-bear. I have shirts 10 years old that have been worn and washed numerous times and they are in better shape than this shirt is new.I wouldn't take possession of the shirt again if it was free plus $25But that's me.\",\n",

They are just way too small even for my newborn baby!  My son weighs 8lbs and is in the 51% for weight and 25% for height and his head is smaller then the average size newborns head of 14\", his is 13\".  Anyhow, these hats are just TINY and do run really really small.  I would of returned them to our local store but I cut and threw out all the tags.

I have no idea where it is since I had been several places that day, and now have only half of a pair that I cannot use anymore.  If I am ever to use this mateless earring again, I will have to purchase an identical pair from Amazon and use this one as a spare (considering the quality, I will need a spare).They only lasted me 2 months, but Amazon won't take a return because the return deadline passed on April 18th.  ICK!  A good piece of jewelery should last years, but these were history after only two months!  I actually purchased them because I thought the latch would prevent loss, but it didn't help at all.  I have owned earrings that worked well, and so I do know that it is possible to get good quality latches.  The manufacturer just cut some corners and now Amazon has my money and I DON'T have a useable pair of earrings.I don't recommend these at all.\",\n",

For the first 2 weeks I had these boots, I thought they were great. The dirt and rock trails I scrambled down were handled with ease, and the boots shed rain like no one's business. Even jumping through mud puddles in Kandahar were no problem. A quick brush cleaned off the mud stuck to them after they were let out to dry, and a small rubdown with a damp washcloth had them looking like new in minutes. An average of about 3 miles a day, and I thought I was done looking for the perfect boot.Then while taking a simple airplane ride, the top open hook eyelet on my right boot caught on a seat belt that was hanging off the seat, and broke in half with nearly no effort. (See picture.) Because they are riveted on, the top eyelets on that boot are now useless on that boot, which later on let water in to the boot while walking through the rain.If these boots were made with better eyelets, or even replaceable ones, they'd be perfect. Until then, I'll keep looking.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Ladies, if you are built with womanly proportions, I recommend that you definitely avoid the Ahh Bra. Please don't be taken in by the hype. If you order these without trying them on, you will regret it when you take a look in the mirror. First of all, they are ugly right out of the box. Secondly, they are even more ugly when you put them on. They do nothing to enhance your womanly shape, unless you are going to a costume ball as a couple of squished honeydew mellons!If you must succomb to the hype, by all means go to a store and try them on. Even the sales ladies told me they are a waste. As for the suggested idea that you can have excellent support by wearing all three of these at a time, I can only wonder why they didn't make them that sturdy to begin with?Any discount chain or department store can sell you a much cuter sports bra with more flattering support and comfort. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this!\",\n",

The doctor also said that tungsten carbide can explode when you try to cut it off and your hand could end up with further injuries from the ring.  So for example, if your hand gets injured and your fingers should get swollen and you would need to have the ring cut off in an emergency room you could end up losing your finger to amputation. Not a good thought!  Also, with further online investigation we read that in animal studies there has been some toxic and carcinogenic properties, but there has not been enough research done on long-term use in humans on this.',\n",

The only problem is there is NO label of any kind on the shawl itself and so you have no idea what it is actually made of. Any kind of shawl from a cheap acrylic to whatever could have been put into this wrapper. In addition, there is no fabric care label to tell you if the shawl is delicate machine washable, has to be dry cleaned or what. This violates USA import laws. Fabric must have a content and care label.I telephoned Amazon.com customer service about the problem with the 2 shawls of this style I ordered as well as one this seller advertised as 100% cashmere and actually is 80% cashmere, 20% silk, that I also ordered. The label on that shawl says it's from clubpashmina.com.All 3 shawls are being returned. The 2 of this style because they are not suitable for gifts with no fabric content or care labels. I have serious doubts they are the claimed 70/30 combination advertised.The other shawl because it is not the claimed 100% cashmere.Be aware, you may not get what is shown or advertised !\",\n",

I tried to fix it myself, but it was impossible!! I cannot believe there is not some sort of quality control that checks the product before shipping; why would they ship out so defective?! Now I am stuck with them, as shipping them back would cost as much or more than I paid for them in the first place. I guess my 3 yr old has new dress up shoes. Yay for her.

There is no space for a sack of hair that falls to the top of the shoulders behind the neck, which is the whole point of a snood style. What you get is a hair net with large squares, no elegant drape for containing long hair. My neck is uncovered and all my hair is held up close to my head. It is about the size of a small beret, with at most, 1 inch of overhang in back. Too bad, if it were just made larger and tried out for actual use on real women\\'s heads, it would be nice. I\\'m still looking for a real snood. Very disappointing. It might look like a real snood (as in the picture) on young girls, to age 8 or 9 years.',\n",

Worse the lace at the band cuts in at the ribs and rips at your skin. If you are at all sensitive to lace this bra is NOT for you, it is not lines well enough and the band is neither wide nor protective enough for a larger chest.\",\n",

This product was intended for women that already have a FIRM bum but are looking for a little more lift or \"oomph\". If you have a jiggly butt whatsoever, save yourself the time and money!! This was not at all designed to cheat your way into a nice butt!This review has nothing against the seller or product itself, it\\'s just my own body shape and how it translated through these panties.

       "  'reviewText': \"I've never seen cloth quite like this. You can actually see right through a single layer of this material! I had wondered why they got such rave reviews but several people commented about them not lasting for long. Perhaps they were better quality material at one time and now Hanes is cutting corners. I can't imagine they'll last long. It's too bad as otherwise they look nice and fit well.Being a statistician, I decided to measure the difference between Hanes and the other brand I had around, Polo by Ralph Lauren. The Polo ones cost 3.7 times as much, so you'd expect better quality. It turns out that you're getting 23.4 grams of added material per pair with Polo (32.5% more, calculations below). The probability of this difference happening by chance is quite slim (0.008). Given the price difference, this may be reasonable. However the Hanes brand is so thin that I'm not sure they're better than not wearing any underwear at all.Note that in the measurements below, the Polo boxers were almost certainly from different batches measured six months to a year apart. The extra wear likely increased the variability in that brand. The Hanes were all from the same package and had been through the wash only twice.> Polo_Price  &lt;- 38/3> Hanes_Price &lt;- 17.10/5> (Price_Ratio &lt;- Polo_Price / Hanes_Price)[1] 3.7037>> # Weight in grams for 5 pairs of each.> Polo  &lt;- c(108,95,84,105,85)> Hanes &lt;- c(74,72,71,73,70)> mean(Polo) - mean(Hanes)  # Mean difference[1] 23.4> mean(Polo) / mean(Hanes)  # Mean ratio[1] 1.325> t.test(Polo,Hanes)Welch Two Sample t-testdata:  Polo and Hanest = 4.6837, df = 4.163, p-value = 0.008548alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 095 percent confidence interval:9.741 37.059sample estimates:mean of x mean of y95.4  72.0\",\n",

It reminds me of those reusable shopping bags.The top and bottom were cut separately, and the top was cut crooked, so the stripes on the top half all slant slightly downwards, while the bottom is horizontal. It looks ridiculous. The belt was broken as well, it won\\'t latch.I e-mailed the seller to complain that I received a defective dress, and they demanded pictures before they would authorize a return or replacement.  I don\\'t know about you, but there is no way I\\'m sending pictures of myself wearing a short dress to someone in China over $7.00.  Creepy.Steer clear of this item and this seller.UPDATE:A few days after posting this review, I received an e-mail asking for my phone number to \"arrange a refund by conference call\". I didn\\'t respond. Tonight, I got a phone call at 10:05 pm from a California number and was informed that they would give me a full refund IF I removed the negative feedback. I advised that I would be happy to update my review to say I received a call at 10:00 at night saying I could have a refund if I removed my review, but I wasn\\'t going to remove the negative feedback, as I received a very poor quality item. The woman on the phone argued with me and said I would only get my refund if I removed the negative feedback.I guess I\\'m out the $7, too bad.UPDATE:An hour after updating this review, I received another e-mail from the seller asking me to remove it. I contacted Amazon customer service regarding this terrible experience and they informed me that it agianst the Amazon policy for a seller to ask you to remove feedback. If they do the same to you, report it!!Or better yet- stay away from this company!!',\n",

On day one after receiving it, here is how it stacks up against common complaints:Handle Quality: The plastic handles on mine were received without scratches or paper glued to it; the protective paper was taped on and easy to remove.Handle Screws: I haven't used the bag yet, so I don't know how they will hold up. However, based on other reviewer's issues, I will be supergluing the screws in.Material Quality: It's a $30 purse. What do you expect? It's adequate quality for the price. No holes, no tears, no fraying.Smell: This thing absolutely REEKS. I have a very dulled sense of smell, and this thing still smells unbelievably bad. I'm letting it air out for a few days before I start using it.I will be updating this review probably a few times over the next few weeks to give people an idea of how it holds up.UPDATE: 4-5 DAYS LATERI superglued all six screws in, but still haven't started using this purse yet, since I'm waiting on a wallet to arrive. (Last purse had one built in)Smell: The horrific chemical smell is gone. I febreezed the thing four or five times in the first couple of days, then left it alone for the rest of the week. Now it just smells like leather.UPDATE: FIRST DAY OF USEThe interior lining of the purse has ripped in one spot and is starting to rip in another. I didn't pack it too full; it's still plenty roomy. I'm returning it. There's no excuse for the thing to rip on day 1.\",\n",

Save your money and order from another seller for a few bucks more. At least it will be wearable. Will not order from this seller again. Cannot even have it taken in as it is so short.',\n",

I reported it to the sellers and they promptly replied back, sending me a prepaid label and I sent it back. The second one I received looked alright, until further inspection I found that the one of the inner pockets had a big hole in it, and my mother discovered a small hole forming on the top near the shoulder hem.Definitely not worth buying. Material way too think to last long. I never even got to wear it. I'm not sure what I'll do with it. My mother sewed the pocket up, but I'm too scared to wear it in fear of it just completely falling apart at the seams.\",\n",

The color is great, the size is perfect and it is totally chic for the price! However, if you have ever ordered a cheap bag or faux leather from Hong Kong than you know what smell I am talking about when I say this bag SMELLS! It is an overwhelming toxic smell associated with cheap materials in mass produced knock-off bags etc. The smell can only be compared to burning plastic and/or fresh laid tar on a newly paved road. Currently the bag is sitting on my patio airing out. I am hoping that I can get rid of the smell. Oh an get this! I took off the detachable strap and left it under a couch pillow by mistake, and my husband is laying down one day and says \"What is that like chemical smell? It smells like street tar!\" Yeah, its that serious!In short: Adorable bag, but the toxic smell makes it impossible to use. People will be thinking \"why do you smell like mothballs and tar?\" not \"cute bag\"',\n",

This bra is not for plus sized women with larger busts. It looks nothing like the one in the picture. The under wires are so uncomfortable. I always buy under wire bras and this one felt like it was poking me to death and digging in under my breasts. The front of the bra sticks up and out (the under wire) right between the cleavage and it is very visible under any top. Getting it on was no picnic. I can usually reach back and snap it shut but this one refused as it felt too short. I had to turn it around and snap it then turn it back. It was horrible and too tight. I tried to adjust the straps and that helped a bit but still my breasts were sticking out (muffin top). Nothing I did worked. All I keep thinking is that there is a reason they show these bras on skinny people in the pictures.If you do buy this bra buy it 3 sizes bigger than your normal size otherwise you will be disappointed like I am. The price for this bra is too high. The materiel is horrible and stiff, no softness to it.\",\n",

I bought this for a formal engagement and  had my husband pull this shoes and stretched it until my feet could comfortably fit in these shoe...I simply could not return the shoe because it was delivered the day before the event so I was desperate and had to make it work. My feet were able to fit into the shoes but just for me to walk from my vehicle straight to my sit at the event..I sat all  thought-out the event and couldn't budge...I was looking fly but couldn't walk around. The shoes are gorgeous but the front tips of the shoes seems to losing a lot of its glitter and  revealing the material beneath not cute at all.Theses shoes are a comfortable high but the fit is terrible I would recommend ordering a 1/2 size bigger if you're planning to actually walking around in these...what I observed is that the left side of the shoes is manufactured much smaller that the right side and this wasn't an issue with my feet ...would purchase this again but only if it were on sale too expensive for a poor fit. THE Packaging:  the box the shoes came in was old and damaged it looked like the shoe was in the warehouse for years it did not appear to be a newer shoe..it appears that these shoes were sitting on a shelf for years or even months.. I'll have to give these shoes away because I will not be able to squeeze my feet into them again...a waste of my money.\",\n",

Just to be clear that the strange fit is not due to me ordering the wrong size, my underbust measures 29&#34; and my bust measures 34&#34;, so I should be a 30D. Based on the reviews of the cups running small, I ordered a 30DD. Although the cup itself and the band are the right size, the placement of the cups on the band is wrong. The cups are just too far apart. The fullest part of the cup is off to the side instead of in front, so not only does it look weird, it causes the gap in the center to be too big so the cups cut across the breast instead of cupping them. Usually when this happens, it means you need to go down a band size (and up a cup size) to make the cups closer together, but this is the smallest size available. And this is not a problem in other brands I own because I should wear 30 band, not smaller. Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to return this and get something else instead.',\n",

Okay, she hasn't worn it yet, so I'll come back with an update.The blouse looks really cute, so I ordered a bigger one for me. I am normally a medium, and I ordered XL, which is the right size. BUT the fabric is so flimsy and the item is so poorly made it came apart on me. I put it on for work one day and by the time I arrived at the office, the right side was completely torn!. Thankfully I was wearing a tank underneath and had thread and a needle available. Neddless to say I threw this blouse away.Now I am expecting to see what happens to my niece. Her blouse fabric looks a bit stronger.\",\n",

I have been back and forth with them on several occasions until i decided to just avoid their products.When i ordered this shirt they sent me the wrong size so i had to return it. it was one big hassle! Even to return the item was a problem. The communication with them was very poor and they took a long time to respond. i asked them to send a replacement instead and told them of the item i wanted. For some reason they said it was not in stock even though it was saying 'in stock'. I ended up buying the shirt myself and ask them to reimburse me for the previous shirt.The sizing is other problem. Even when i think i have purchased the right size it comes with a different fit. I buy a shirt from them today and it will fit well, then i buy another shirt tomorrow with the same size and it fits big or small. It is really frustrating to buy from this seller.\",\n",

I wear nothing to bed, so for me, gowns are something to be worn earlier in the evening or during breakfast time, so they should be really nice, sexy and good looking.I'd hoped it would be more shear, to add a bit of 'oomph' to it, but alas, it looks like something my grandma would've liked if she were still alive.\",\n",

I guess they must be only for running - maybe they are balanced right for a runner.

It looks, and is, very cheaply made! The material is thin and light weight. The zipper is cheap and flimsy. There is a large gap on both sides of the zipper. If they had taken the style and color and used better materials, and completely closed off the zippered area, this would have been a great purse. I know some will think what do I expect for the price. But, I'd rather pay more and get a purse I can be proud of, feel will keep my items safely inside, and will last for a while. Seriously this purse is not worth the $40.00 I paid, in my opinion. I returned it.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Just received these crocs.  They will have to go back.  The really wide spacious toe is diminished in this style, somewhat. Hoped they would be right because they don't have holes so drier for winter.  I love the light weight of crocs, and the price (not like keens, $$, which won't do for anything but hiking or walking--not dressy at all) But the wide toe, especially on the inner side (by big toe) is why I like crocs.  This pair is not as boxy as many clogs or crocs.  It looks more like a normal shoe, but I could not tell that from the pictures, although I tried.  I've had a surgery for a bunion and am attentive towards getting that wide toe area in a shoe.  Also bought the Shayna and it is much better, plus dressy.  The 10 is too big for my 9.5 size, but maybe it will shrink if I wash it.  I tied it on with a ribbon around the back strap, looping over the top of foot.  They stay on  that way and are VERY comfortable, with the wide toe. The top strap is loose.\",\n",

A front closure style is not one I would normally go with, but seemed to be one of the only options. I ordered my normal size, only to find out that I could barely even get the bottom clip closed. At that point I did not even try to close it, just gave up. Also, it has next to nothing in the way of lining, to add a touch of modesty in cold environments if you know what I mean. It just did not work out for me and I am returning it. If you are going to try it out yourself, I would suggest ordering a size or two larger than your normal band size.\",\n",

When I received it nearly a month after purchasing, it was absolutely nothing like the picture:1) I am a size 6. I wear a M. This fit like a L or XL. The skirt was short, but the waist was loose and the arms way too long.2) There is zero puff in the sleeves. They just hang straight down.3) There are really bright gold sequins on the collar. It was way muted down in the pic. I feel like it's a night club collar on a frumpy dress.Please note that because this ships from China, they don't like returns because of the shipping costs. You get a partial credit. They currently are telling me I can get a $3 credit, and give it away to someone. Unacceptable. I want at least $10 credit, and I will donate it to Goodwill. I wouldn't gift this to anyone in good conscious. I am awaiting their reply.\",\n",

I was wearing Saucony Walking shoes at the time which have the wide toe box and the cusion plus the wide sole on the shoe.  My feet never hurt me.  I bought a pair of Avia's and they pinched my little toe in addition to being super narrow!  My friend at work said to try Skechers as they were very cushy and comfy.  I ordered a 10E, normally I wear a 10B,. as in looking at the pictures they seemed narrow.  I just took them out of the box and put them on.  They are tight, hard and there is no flex to the sole.  I barely had any lace to tie trying to loosen them up.  I would even fathom wearing them to work.  Back in the box they go and back to Amazon.  I am a little disappointed and just ordered New Balance non slip which are a little more expensive but hoping they will be just what I am looking for!.\",\n",

I would re order a larger size, because the jacket is a nice design, but to be honest if the 1X isn't large enough - and I only got that size so I could wear a sweater underneath, there is no way another size would work or that I would want to take the chance. As a result it is being returned.I personally felt like this was a bit of false advertising on the sellers part, especially after reading so many negative reviews in regards to the size (again, after the fact).

       "  'reviewText': \"Given that I'm small (5'3&#34;, 104 lbs, and 34 A bust) I thought this one-size top would fit me. I was wrong. First, the length is very short--shorter than it looks in the picture unless you keep stretching it down with your hands. Second, the mock turtleneck is ridiculously tight (and I have a slender neck). It is so tight that I felt a bit suffocated. The top was fitted on my torso. It wasn't uncomfortable there but it was definitely tight, and the fabric is very thin, so it shows the bra lines. Then, the sleeves were way too loose! They looked baggy and sloppy. As you can imagine, it all looked out of proportion, with a squeezed neck, oversized and formless sleeves, and skimming torso. The fabric feels like thick hosiery, but not in a good way--it's not particularly soft, and it feels like it would not breathe well. Also, there are seams on the sides of the body that give this top a sporty look, like it's a top for running or working out. There are no redeeming qualities and I can't imagine myself wearing this for anything, as it doesn't look or feel good. I would say the only good thing was the color (rust), which is a beautiful brownish red, but what good is it if the top doesn't fit? I understand that at this price point the merchandise won't be perfect, but it should at least work in some way.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I like wrist watches and have many of them.  For years I have seen Invicta watches advertised on Amazon and have been curious to own one.  Invicta makes many interesting styles.  So when the Invicta Men\\'s 1439 Russian Diver Rose Dial Black Rubber Watch became available for me to review I jumped at the opportunity.First off, this is a massive wrist watch.  Its size is absolutely huge, and it is not one for small, skinny people.  I am pretty big myself and yet it still looks way oversized on my wrist.  I think this watch would be a very attractive watch if it were about 25% smaller in size.The watch arrives well-packaged in a yellow hinged box.  Product instructions are obviously intended for several watches in the Invicta line, but they are clearly written, and there is no confusion about how to operate this watch.The description and picture of this watch on Amazon is a little misleading.  It is described to be a \"rose\" dial, but a more accurate description of its color would be new penny copper.  It is a pretty unique color for a watch dial.The band on this watch is very big to match the oversized nature of the watch itself.  It is made of thick rubber and has some copper-colored cylinders that match the dial on each side to give it a little style.  The band on the watch I received is so thick it barely fits into the clasp, and it is actually a little difficult to fasten the watch on my wrist.  Perhaps with time this will loosen up a bit.  There is room on the band to fit a wrist larger than mine, although not a whole lot larger.  My wrist is not that big -- I usually have to remove a link or so from the band when I buy a new watch -- so this band could stand to be a little longer.The dial and numbers on it are massive.  It is a very plain look with little distinction other than the outline of a diver\\'s helmet at the 12 o\\'clock position on the dial.  The numbers are large and easy to read in daylight.  Minute markings, though, are numbered every 5 minutes with a single line at the 2-1/2 minute mark.  This is not a watch that will be easy to set with great accuracy.  It has a thin second hand that is plainly visible but not distinctive.  The hour and minute hands have \"luminous\" stripes on them, but there is nothing luminous about them at all.  I tried to see them in both dim and dark light, and they were not the least bit visible.  This watch would be useless in the dark.  There is no day or date function on this watch.  It tells time, and that\\'s it.  Matching its oversize dimension, this watch is very thick.  Way too thick in my opinion, especially for a watch that is largely featureless.  I can picture accidentally banging it against the edge of doorways pretty easily.The crown on the watch is concealed by a screw-on cap attached to a small copper chain.  This adds a lot of unnecessary bulk to the watch and, unless you fasten the watch up high on your wrist, it will interfere with movement of the wrist.  There is a gasket inside the cap that is most likely intended to help keep moisture from getting under the crown.  The watch is reported to be water resistant to 100 meters, but I can\\'t imagine anyone wearing this watch under water.  It would be impossible to see the hands under water unless there was a lot of light.I put the watch on and showed it to my wife.  She laughed at me.  It was a \"what were you thinking when you got this\" type of laugh.  She did not like the appearance of the watch at all.  In fairness, a few people at work commented favorably about the watch when they saw me wearing it.  Big as it is, I suspect it will easily draw attention from others.  As the day went on I found the watch to be kind of heavy and too bulky to wear all day with comfort.Invicta says the Russian Diver Rose Dial Black Rubber Watch has a MSRP of $595.  In my opinion no one in their right mind would spend that much for this watch.  Amazon is currently selling it for about $97.  Even that seems a little high for a watch with so few features.  Perhaps other watches in the Invicta line would be worth this price, but this one is not.  If you are a very large man who likes massive watches with stylish appearance and don\\'t really care about having any other features besides telling the time, you may be happy with this watch at a lower price.  Personally, I was very disappointed in this watch.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'See update at the end.-----Packaging (for the dress, not the shipping box): Simple plastic bag taped by a small piece of standard tape.Color: I bought the Turquoise and the actual color is **COMPLETELY DIFFERENT** as compared to the picture. The picture looks sky blue or light blue turquoise while the actual dress is dark green turquoise. Minus one star (I personally don\\'t mind else I\\'d take off more stars).Length: I\\'m 5\\'2\" and this is just short of hitting the floor when barefoot.Size: I\\'m usually a regular 2 / petite 4 or XS and smaller on top. For this dress, I ordered a Small and it fits fine. I took off half a star because of the fact the dress does not look as slimming as on the model even though it falls straight down in the front. Compared to other dresses of this style this adds a few pounds.Fabric: Very soft t-shirt like. This could easily be for sleeping.Straps: They are very long and I don\\'t think they look as nice as the model when tied in the same style but this isn\\'t a big deal; it\\'s easy to tie them in other styles or tuck them inside.Other: This dress comes with clear hanging straps to hang onto hangers. Normally this would be a plus but they are stiff and sewn pointing outward so you have to double check / adjust that you\\'ve actually tucked this inside when you are wearing it. I took off the half a star for this.-----UPDATE - downgraded to one star: After wearing this for a day, I\\'ve downgraded the ratings. The clear inside straps kept popping out so I\\'ve cut them off. The elastic for the top is already losing its stretch after one day; I\\'m very small so its not me! Going through the washer and wearing a couple more times, at least three of the elastic have broken. On the plus side, I tried bunching the dress up on the side of my hip and tying it with a string or hair tie band; the dress then drapes nicely and gives a better better look.',\n",

I thought about keeping them so I didn\\'t have to bother with the return process, but they also don\\'t come close to fitting the same (they don\\'t hold everything in like the previous pair I bought). I just contacted the seller for the second time (first time I didn\\'t received anything back). I will write an additional review following return to let you know how the return process went. Very disappointed in this product.The following is a review of a pair \"high waist leather skinny leggings...\" with the same description but was from a different seller.  These pants are awesome.  I am going to buy a couple of additional pairs for future use.  These ride up higher than I am used to but it prevents any \"rol over\" and fits like a girdle (LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!).  I have even worn these under my skinny jeans which makes them fit even better.  They do not breath so they probably wouldn\\'t be great to wear in warm weather but are perfect in cold weather. They are not leather but and are little cheap but for the price they can\\' be beat.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons #1they are a little cheap and may only last for 1season (I wear these at least 2 times a week and received them in the fall) #2 you can see a small amount of the white tag through the top portion of the seam which doesn\\'t matter if our top covers your behind but I makes it look like you have \"popped\" the seam because they are too tight.

       "  'reviewText': \"I just read a recent review that wasn't available when I placed my order last week. They gave the product 2 stars, but I can only give them 1 and even that is too many.  These leggings are cheap Chinese garbage. They smell like they where made in a petroleum  factory and this smell doesn't easily wash out.  Also after washing they became scratchy and unwearable and I washed them in cold water on a gentle cycle, inside-out as instructed. I too agree that they have a very low rise and skinny long legs that stretch out to fit whatever shape you try and put into them. You can image the bigger the shape the thinner the fabric will become.  I don't know where all of the 5 star reviews came from?  Maybe they received a different product. Don't buy these leggings, and save your money, they aren't worth even $10 to toss in the trash.\",\n",

I really like the sleek look of these. I wanted something comfortable, which is why I was buying Teva's, but also something that could be dressed up with a skirt. These just do not agree with my feet. I was hoping, but I should have known better, my feet are a little wide and so the front straps pinch into my skin. The skin was bulging from all sides on the first two straps, the last one (the one closest to the toes) however was really loose and barely touched my foot. So back in the box they go. Also the foot bed was really, really long. So I suggest these shoes to those with narrow feet and get a half size smaller than you normally wear to account for the long foot bed, otherwise don't go Kokomo.\",\n",

These jeans wear horribly. They are a few months old and they are falling apart. Belt loops have fallen off. The coin pocket area of both pair I purchased is ripped. To address these issues, I have not worn them for any kind of manual labor work. Normal office work, and I have never used the coin pocket.  Levis quality has went down the drain.

I was horrified when I opened the package and it smelled like it was made out of toxic chemicals.  I immediately threw it in the washer machine.  This had very little effect on the very strong odor.  I then soaked it repeatedly in a mixture of detergent and baking soda for several days and have now been reduced to letting it sit in the sun hoping the smell will  eventually dissipate.  I have never received an article of clothing that smells this horrible.  It appears to come from the elastic used for the support at the base.  I checked it yesterday and the smell has decreased, but not to the point where I would be willing to put it against my skin.  I would strongly advise against purchasing this bra, especially if you are planning to use it as a nursing mom like me.  Toxic chemicals against where my baby will feed is NOT an option.',\n",

I have an extreme curved last foot and the original PureConnect was the only running shoe that was totally comfortable for me, sparing me from any lower back, hip or joint pain. I tried the second generation (this shoe) on at a store and not only did I go from a solid 9.5 size in the original PureConnect to a size 10 in this one, I was also immediately uncomfortable with foot pain. The fit is totally different; it's now a straight shoe inside that appears to be curved on the outside. What a disappointment. To take something that was so wonderful for so many people, selling out wherever it was stocked, and change it so drastically is nothing short of insanity to me. I'm going to buy all of the first generations that I can find (which is proving to be a huge and almost impossible challenge)and hope that my supply will last in hopes that the Brooks company will come to its senses and change the structure of this shoe back. If you're a first generation PureConnect runner like I am, I recommend that you try this shoe on in a store prior to spending any money on it.\",\n",

I had the same problem with the gorun2 but I though this shoe has to be better. I was wrong. I though I could at least walk in the shoe if nothing else. Well, It is really not that great for walking either. It does not feel bad. It feels sort of ok. The biggest issues are breathable; poor build quality and very poor wear. I get tired faster also. One day I went out for a run and in less than .5 miles it was just not fun, so I walked home and changed shoes. I ran the entire course and set a PR in the shoes I changed to. The shoe I changed into were a very high-end shoe similar to a racing flat but the difference was unreal. I had wanted to try the bionic but have seen complaints on its breathability also.I do think the shoe is better than some ratings as the midfoot support is strong. It is too much for me and I have high arches. I was sure I could make it work but it looks like I was wrong. This shoe is cheaper and looks more durable than the gorun2 but I think they are still behind most major shoes companies out there.I will update If I have better luck. I have put a lot in tring to make this shoe work.\",\n",

But the worst is that the shoe is incredibly narrow.  I have always worn a regular shoe, however, my feet hung over the sides of these shoes, causing me to roll over when I walked in them.  Also, the sole is incredibly light, and lacks the cushion I would expect from a shoe of this cost.  This is the second pair of Merrell's that I've returned because of significant flaws in construction, and so I likely will never order from them again.\",\n",

They felt soft in my hands.  When I put them on, they were pinchy and felt like nylon fibers under my feet.  Very uncomfortable.  I tried to break them in and wear them a while.  The pinchy feeling went away, but they were so tight around my ankles that they left indentations in my skin.  I've given them a few tries.  I also gave a pair to my mother to try, and she hates them too.  I don't know if they are made wrong...too small in size....or if it's the blend of polyester, nylon, latex, & spandex, with not enough cotton in them.  Actually, I think it's both of those reasons.  I've been wearing some old Hanes socks I have that are in good condition, and they feel more cottony.These socks are going in the garbage.\",\n",

If i had the chance i would demand my money back and return this this garbage, i bough a similar belt at macys or jcpenny that has lasted through tough wear. I never even use this product for work or anything. except when going on on formal dine or event. Yes i paid $30 bucks for this garbage.

       "  'reviewText': 'UPDATE 2/18/12 - A FEW MONTHS LATER NOW, THE SELLER HAS CHANGED THE TITLE TO SAY \"SILVER PLATED\"ORIGINAL REVIEW AND PREVIOUS UPDATES BELOW:I bought one of these chains for under seven bucks. I had wanted it for a particular pendant. I was very curious as to what I would receive since the price was sooo low.The package just arrived and the necklace comes in a beige gift box which reads \"Wilson & Son\" in gold script and then inside the box, the necklace is in a small ziploc type tiny baggie, along with a very nice looking leather/pleather? beige pouch which also has \"Wilson & Sons\" scripted in gold lettering. It was definitely a nice presentation for the price.It does not come in the tan cardboard box with cotton as shown in the pics here on the product page. Also, my chain did NOT have the little circle hanging on it stamped \"925\" which is shown in the 4th picture here on the product page.I take the necklace out of the tiny pouch and am amazed by the thickness of the chain and the nice substantial clasp. It definitely DOES NOT look like a seven dollar chain. The clasp is substantial, but when looking closely at it, it does have a very cheap look to it. The clasp does not look like real sterling. The clasp is also NOT STAMPED 925.Now, the \"but\" comes in.. I am really wondering wether or not this is actually real sterling silver. It is almost too shiny, too silver (if that makes sense?)  The clasp is not stamped. The only \"925\" stamp is found on a tiny ring which is connected to another ring and then that ring is connected to the clasp. The end caps on the chain (where is connects to the rings and then the clasp) are also not stamped. I must say that every chain I have ever owned, wether (white)gold or silver, have been stamped on the clasps as well and also on the endcaps on chains that do have the endcaps.So, while it looks great and seemed to be a super steal of a deal, I am left wondering if it is real or not.The price was amazing and I suppose even for a \"fake\" chain it still looks good, however I would have never willingly/knowingly bought a \"fake\" chain.I did do a websearch for \"Wilson & Son\" and there is a jewelry store in NY, so I guess it is possible that the chains are real, assuming they came from this jeweller. They do have a website which is \"under construction\" at the moment and inoperable. The scripting on the box and pouch does match the scripting on the website in their logo.UPDATE 1/4/12 - THIS CHAIN HAS STARTED TURNING MY WHITE TSHIRT COLLARS GREEN. This is not normal for a sterling chain, in my experience, unless it would come into contact with certain chemicals. Of course those chemicals are NOT on my skin or clothing, so there is no good reason as to why it should be turning colors on me unless it is not actual sterling. I also have nasty green  staining across the whole back of my neck. THESE CHAINS ARE NOT REAL.I uploaded a pic of the back of my neck so you could see it.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I'll begin by revealing I am 57 years old and thus have been wearing jeans for a full 5 decades.  It is safe to say I am aware of what my jean size is.  In fact, as I write this review I am wearing a pair of size 33WX32L Wrangler jeans, one pair of several I own.Which brings us to these 2013 model lined Wrangler jeans, purported to be size 33x32.  The waist size on this pair is so far off I went straight to the size label to see if I had been shipped the wrong size by mistake.  No, the seller apparently got it right but Wrangler has these jeans sized at LEAST one size, if not two, too small.  Come on now, Wrangler has been manufacturing jeans longer than I have been alive and this is ridiculous. And, since these came from an Amazon seller, not Amazon directly, guess who pays the return postage?These jeans were labeled as being made in Mexico (assuming THAT label was accurate).  I suppose when outsourcing to whichever third world nation is the low bidder, little things such as quality control and accuracy in sizing can be overlooked in the interest of saving a buck (or Peso).Lesson learned:  From now on I will try on jeans and personally inspect them before I buy.  So much for buying jeans on Amazon, especially from a third party seller such as Sportsman's Guide.  And, so much for Wrangler in general.\",\n",

Sometimes my choices for entertainment are watching an infomercial or vacuuming the kitchen and I`ve had a lot of complaints about that. One of the most common infomercials is on the topic of this type of bra -- I think there are three names for them but they all look alike -- that offers wonderful, perfect, unbelievably good support, better than any other bras ever made.  EVER.  Would that any of that were true.After flitting from one set of bra reviews on this site to another set, as all three name brands from the infomercials were junk judging by the reviews, I finally found one that had some good reviews and looked like it could have some support.It doesn't.  Anyway, by my calculations you will need to wear seven of these at once if you would like any support.  If you decide to go the bandaid route, two bandaids would cost about $0.20 unless you want one with a super hero.  That will cost extra.\",\n",

Unfortunately, although they were a perfect fit in the calves and across the foot, these boots have a ridiculously wide heal and fat, baggy ankles. Consequently they slipped at the heel and looked awful even though I had the right size (8.5WW). It wasn't worth returning them as I live in Australia and the postage would have been as much as the refund. I donated them to charity. Still can't find boots that work for wide feet and average calves.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I purchased these shoes to replace a very well used similar pair of walking shoes. I loved the old ones. Unfortunately, the quality is not as good as in the past. The sizing leaves a lot to be desired. As suggested by some other reviewers, I ordered the shoes  size larger than I had in the past. The length was OK, but the \"medium\" width is more wide. I also ordered a pair of Rockport sport shoes. They were size 11, but barely. The width was just OK. I will order shoes again, but will not be surprised if they need to be returned for poor size quality control.6month follow up:  I have been wearing these a lot. The more I wear them, the more pain I get. Went to a real shoe store and was shown that the front lateral side of the shoe tapers more narrowly starting near the base of my little toe. The more I walk, especially with orthotics, the more the side of my foot is compressed. Not good. This was not present on previous shoes. I bought a pair of SAS shoes that do not taper. Much, much better. I have worn Rockports for over 20 years. This latest pair don\\'t make it. Lift the sole cover on the inside. Could it be cardboard? This may be the last pair of Rockports that I buy.',\n",
